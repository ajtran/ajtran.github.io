        <h2>Chapter 7: Base Camp - Upper Boy Scout Lake</h2>
        <p>SO AFTER WHAT I CONSIDERED HELL (or the crux), we made it to where we would set up base camp.</p>
        <p>and tbh, i think the worst part about that section too was that i was navigationless like i didnt use my maps
          and follow the trail on my phone and i guess thats on me, but like i had no idea when it was going to end and
          i was just trudging trudging trudging along. AND ALSO at this point, i just couldnt do it in the snow anymore
          and they were following the footprints in the snow, i just said fuck that and veered right because i saw there
          was a path on some slab AND OH MY GOSH DID IT TURN THINGS AROUND. LIKE WOO! NEVER HAVE I MISSED ROCK AND DRY
          GROUND SO MUCH. AND SO WITH THAT NEW FOUND PATH and i think i began to see a few heads over the hill signaling
          we were close, i found enough energy in me to hike it up to Upper Boy Scout Lake.</p>
        <p>anyways, tada. Upper Boy Scout Late (frozen over)</p>

        <p>
          BUT ALSO YOOOOOOO LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS FOOD. A FREAKIN GAME CHANGER. A LIFE SAVER. WHOLYYY. WOW. SO
          GOOD. it's Mountain House and it's dehydrated food and all you have to do is add the right amount of water - i
          emphasize right because we had a couple of mishaps with the amount of water and it's hit or miss because of
          that. anyways so i was saying. it's about $8 a pack but its ooooo so worth it. the flavor that comes from
          this portable pouch is INCREDIBLE. dont just take my word for it. GO TRY IT!
        </p>
        <p>
          ALSO @MOUNTAINHOUSE. SPONSER ME. or just hook it up. ill happily taste test ur meals
