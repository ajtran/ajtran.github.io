        <h2>Part 2: Morning of</h2>
        <p>so, we get in at 3 am. we set up camp, we're all kinda beat but it's the first night, so we're still
          fresh and optimistic, i guess. not a bad situation setting up the tent in the dark, crawling inside and
          then passing tf out.</p>
        <p>BUT THESE FOOLS.. idk what time they wake up and start opening the tent (im beat. literally so tired)
          but all i hear is "omgggg look the mountains" "its so beautiful" like tff. no leave me alone. ill look
          when im ready to open my eyes. goddamn.</p>
        <p>anyways when 9 am rolls through and i do decide to open my eyes, it IS a gorgeous sight. <strong>behold a
          mountain in the background:</strong></p>

        <p>also i always think it's so cool, pulling up somewhere at night, setting up camp in pitch darkness and then
          just waking up to your beautiful surrondings. AND so. it's a good start to the next day. a little sleep
          deprived, but in a new environment, fresh mountain air, got some coffee and we're ready to go. let's rock
          and roll! except we're slow to move and have to stop at a gear shop near by to get crampons because the one
          jabcob had rented were wonky. still a v good morning. peep the cuties</p>
