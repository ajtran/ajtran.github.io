        <h2>Chapter 10: They've Returned</h2>
        <p>and so! not before long! maybe 3 hours since they left and 2.5 hours into my power nap, i hear voices.
          familiar voices. i relunctantly open my eyes and turn to look up at the blindling snow covered mountain and
          see none other than our adventurers returning home!</p>

        <p>they share they had decided to turn back at iceberg lake up the mountain because the word of fresh snowfall
          on the summit had rendered the proposed path impassable and the secondary path known as the 'travese' to be
          of utmost sketchiness and they were most likely not planning to do it, thus it was better for them to
          return to camp and rest up before our descent</p>
