    <h2>Raytracer:</h2>
    <p>I engineered a raytracer from scratch in C++. I simulated an eye and a scene and shot rays from the eye through the scene towards objects in the foreground. If the ray intersects an object, there would be a value on that pixel in the scene. I represented rays as vectors, linear transformations as matrices, and objects as equations, then calculated intersections, Phong shading, shadows, and reflections.</p>

    <h2>Prokudin-Gorskii Images:</h2>
    <p>Given red, green, and blue layers of a colored image, I found the best alignment of the three channels and recreated the colored image. In order to find the shifts that resulted in the best image, I used a pyramid algorithm and calculated the smallest sum of squared differences at each level of the pyramid. I optimized and refined the search by removing white spaces along the borders of each color channel to focus the alignment on the center of the image.</p>

    <h2>Volunteer Applicant Database:</h2>
    <p>I revamped Engineers without Bordersâ€™ previous volunteer application page. I increased accessibility of volunteer information and applications by storing them in a database on Rails. I, then designed a log in portal where project managers and admins could go to search through volunteers, contact them, and assign them to open projects.</p>
